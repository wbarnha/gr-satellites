gr-satellites is an OOT module encompassing a collection of telemetry decoders
that supports many different Amateur satellites. This open-source project
started in 2015 with the goal of providing telemetry decoders for all the
satellites that transmit on the Amateur radio bands. It suports most popular
protocols, such as AX.25, the GOMspace NanoCom U482C and AX100 modems, an
important part of the CCSDS stack, the AO-40 protocol used in the FUNcube
satellites, and several ad-hoc protocols used in other satellites.
